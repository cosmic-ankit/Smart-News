*************************** Lecture 23  **********************

* Render - >We render the files in app.js in class based componet. Render is a lifecycle method, jab react kisi component ko load karti hai to series of method load hote hai and that is lifecycle method

* In class based compmnents of react the syntax changes like we use peops and state in a different manner here

*  Now what we wanna do over here is that we will craete a news app named "Smart NEWS". It will hava a nav bar then we will make a news container component below it and inside it there will be news items having different news and then when we will click on those news items, a news detail page will open which will have that news.

*  We will use news api over here

* Rce is a snippet for class based component and rcep is class based component with props set up.


********************** Lecture 24 *************************

* So in this lecture i have created an api from news api and made a json filr where i have extracted the top headline ka  data.

* We have given the body to the news item using the bootstrap component of card.

* In class bassed component to use props we use this.props.propname.

* this.props is an object

*   let {title, discreption} = this.props;
But here we are using the destructuring the titlle will get the first value of this.props that is also title and discreption will get the second value of this.props which is the discreption itself. so we can use title and discreption in the whole compmnent directly

* We are passing title and discreption as a props in news items through NewsContainer

* To make row in bootstrap we use row class
* To make column in bootstrap we use column class

* In bootstrap there can be a 12 column in a row, so md -4 is a class which makes the width of the column.
Md-4 means this column will take the size of 4 columns


**************** Lecture 25 ******************************

Understanding state in class based component :-

* To use state we declare a constructor in which we call super() method. Then we make an object of state using

this.state = { 
    count:0,
    hello: "Hello
}

* then we can directly use their value in the constructor by using  this.state.count

* To update the value of state we use this.setstate() method. 
 this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });

*******************************************

* btn-sm is the bootstrap class used to make a button smaller


************************ Lecture 26 ****************************

* So here we have created a map function to iterate over the every elenent in an array and then  we are passing the props through it.

* We have limited the length of decription and title sp that there will be uniformity in each card
